            "body": "<p>A figure of freedom, grace and power, the eagle holds a prominent place in the history and culture of our great country, as well as throughout modern and ancient civilizations.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Carroll purposely created this collection to recognize the dedicated men and women who have served and continue to serve in the armed forces, as well as to honor the everyday citizen who loves his country and is proud to show it.</p>\n \n<p>With names like Liberty, Republic and Union, the rings commemorate historic eras, icons and prominent organizations of the United States. Many incorporate the eagles styled after well-known Americana that can still be seen on coinage, old buildings, currency, badges and medals of achievement.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been interested in symbols of the United States. It started many years ago when I worked as a page on the floor of the Illinois State Senate. It was there I started noticing the icons and symbols of our state and country. All those great images piqued my curiosity. My designs are an extension of that early attraction,&rdquo; says Carroll.</p>\n\n<p>The Carroll Collection is not typical of other patriotic rings on the market because they have been created to pay tribute to the history, culture and heritage of the United States. These rings are prominent, highly detailed and noticeably unique.</p>\n\n<p>Made one-at-a-time with unsurpassed craftsmanship and durability, each ring can be worn for a lifetime and passed down to future generations to cherish.  Theyâ€™re 100% guaranteed and copyrighted and registered in the U.S. Library of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"collection\">The Collection</a> to see all of our handsome rings and to choose one for yourself or someone special.</p>",

Lost wax casting is a timeless jewelry-making method used by the finest craftsmen in the world for hundreds of years. It is at this point that the ultimate beauty of a fine piece of jewelry originates.</p><p>The original ring design begins as a sketch on paper. Then it is hand-carved out of a single piece of wax. With surgical precision, every feather, shield and shape is intricately carved into a three-dimensional model. Some designs take several weeks to complete.</p><p>After the wax model is finished, it is enclosed in a mold and fired in a furnace that vaporizes the wax. Molten metal is then poured into the mold&rsquo;s cavity replacing the wax.  Once it has been carefully cooled, the metal perfectly reproduces the hand-carved wax model that has been fired away. Thus the process is called lost wax casting.</p><p>A mold is then made from the model to reproduce single or multiple editions of the piece in 18k, 14k or 10k gold or sterling silver. After the ring is cast to your exact size and specifications, it is polished by hand and stamped with the letters USA, which is your assurance of its American origins.</p><p>Look through our Eagle Rings and find the one that honors your military service, celebrates your love of country or just looks and feels right for you.

            "body": "<p>Mike Carroll was born and raised in Park Ridge, Illinois, the son of a local newspaper publisher. Growing up in the newspaper business, Mike learned early on the power of the press in keeping the American way of life free and safe for democracy. It also fueled his love of country and greatly in uenced his later decision to create The Carroll Collection of U.S. Eagle Rings.</p><p>Today Mike is regarded as one of the world&rsquo;s most progressive jewelry talents. He designed his  rst ring in the cockpit of an airplane at 24,000 feet. Carroll came up with the idea to create rings with an eagle motif during a  ight between Chicago and a small town in Florida.</p><p>&ldquo;I used to  y the Chicago/Florida route on a regular basis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As most pilots would agree, long  ights are hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. I actually sketched my  rst design during one of those  ights â€“ the boring part.&rdquo;</p><p>Carroll made his  rst ring for himself. Without a formal education in jewelry making, he enrolled in local classes to bring his  rst design to life. He worked with some of Chicago&rsquo;s top jewelry crafters and designers. &ldquo;Most jewelers focus on popular &lsquo;fashion&rsquo; designs. They were helpful and non-threatened by my original eagle designs.&rdquo;</p><p>His hobby turned into a business as family and acquaintances responded to his initial ring design. Later, Carroll felt compelled to create a top quality ring design for his daughter and son-in-law and friends serving in the US Marine Corps. Carroll boasts his Marine Corps Ring to be &ldquo;The Finest USMC ring out there. Period.&rdquo; His customers would agree.</p><p>Carroll is known for his passion for  ying and for all forms of transportation. He drives tractors, trucks, Harleys, boats and planes. He is also passionate about his patriotism and is able to express it through his eagle ring collection styled after well-known Americana. &ldquo;My U.S. eagle rings recognize those who love their country and are proud to show it. There are a lot of people who want to show their patriotism. This is a great way to do it. Rings can be a very personal thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Mike and Maribeth Carroll run the business together from their studios near Chicago and their home in northern Michigan.</p>",
